This project enables hiding messages within various types of files (images, text, audio, and video). The sender selects a cover file and embeds secret text within it using efficient algorithms, creating a stego file of the same format. The stego file is then transmitted to the recipient through communication networks. Upon receiving the stego file, the recipient decodes it using the appropriate algorithm to extract the hidden secret text.

In the sample folder keep adding the sort of data you would want to hide the data behind and then choose from the switch case options given by the program.
